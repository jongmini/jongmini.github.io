            I'm a full stack web developer.<br>
            I enjoy creating beautiful websites with focus on user interaction for the front-end as much as writing SQL queries, setting up database relationships and building server applications for the back-end.<br>
            I have recently become a web developer but I have been a creative and logical problem-solver for most of my life. I am a curious person by nature and have been able to travel and live abroad for several years experiencing how people from different parts of the world live. I am passionate about projects that help improve people's lives and I am always looking for opportunites to learn something new.

                   I love riding my bicycle around the bay area. However, bike riding in San Francisco can be tricky because the hills are particularly challenging. I wanted to create an app for bike riders that show directions as well as elevation information for each routes.  Bike There is a bicycle-commuting app that displays a turn-by-turn direction as well as elevation information along a chosen route. Bike There is great for tourists and commuters who are looking for a safe and easy bike route.  <br><br>

                <strong>Design process: </strong> <br>
                I decided to use Google Maps for this project because it is very familiar interface. However, when I had started the project, I had very little knowledge of JavaScript and JSON and I had to learn the necessary technology in a short amount of time. The first step was figuring out that the JSON response from the Google Directions API included coordinate information at every turn. This information was parsed, repackaged and sent to the Google Elevation API to get the Google Elevation JSON response. Lastly, Google Chart is used to display the corresponding elevation information on the map. <br><br>

                Good or Evil is an annonymous posting blog where users can post, comment and rate annonymously. A user can see how other uses view his/her posts as well as how he/she votes other posts. The concept for this group project was inspired by a growing interest on the web for a space where social interactions can take place anonymously, such as secret sharing sites. We wanted to take that idea further and create a space where a discussion around whether a post is good or evil can happen anonymously. <br><br>

                <strong>Design process:</strong><br>
                Coding as a group had its own set of challenges as the team members had different set of skills and interests. However, we had a specific vision and a goal in mind and met together throughout the day to discuss what we want to tackle together as well as how to “divide and conqueror” the project. We divided the group to handle the back-end and front-end separately. I was in-charge of the back-end portion of the project and the front-end user interactivity. <br><br>

                <strong>Anything interesting about the project:</strong></br>
                This group project was an opportunity to learn about collaborative programming experience. We learned how to program collaboratively using the Github version controlling system and learned how to work through code conflicts and merges. It was a great way to understand what a real programming environment is like where many developers will work on the same project collaboratively. <br><br>

                <strong>Inspiration for the Project:</strong><br>
                Raspberry Pi is a credit card-sized computer that can be used with various sensors, LEDs and other simple hardware components to build relatively simple projects. I had an interest in building a project using a Raspberry Pi because I wanted to build a web application that interacts with the physical world. <br>
                I got the idea for the project as I thought about the plants I had neglected during the 12-week immersive course and wondered what plants would say if they could speak.<br><br>
                <strong>Design Process:</strong><br>
                The hardware component was a challenge because it was outside of our area of expertise. We spent the first couple of days setting up the Raspberry Pi and the analogue soil moisture sensor to measure the data properly. However, with resilience and trial-and-error, the hardware component was set up to read the soil moisture data and send the data to the server. <br><br>

            <div class="col-md-12">
              <div class="desc col-md-4">
              
                In a typical project of similar scale, it would make sense to have a single server handle data and client interaction. However, we wanted to experiment with setting up separate servers to handle the data collection and the client interaction separately. We also decided to go away from Ruby on Rails server and decided to take on the challenge of learning how to build this project using NodeJS, a server-side application written in JavaScript, and Express. <br>
                As you can see in the diagram below, the service-layer server handles the data-related logic using the PostgreSQL database. The client-layer server handles the client interaction through the browser, data logic to send a twitter notification and requests to the service-layer for appropriate data. The client-layer server stores client information in the MongoDB database. <br><br>
